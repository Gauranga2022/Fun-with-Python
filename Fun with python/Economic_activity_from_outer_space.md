# Exploring Economic Activity from Outer Space  
### *A Julia Notebook for Processing and Analyzing Satellite Nighttime Lights*

## Overview
This Julia notebook demonstrates how satellite nighttime lights data can be used as an indicator of economic activity. Satellite imagery, particularly nighttime lights, is increasingly recognized as a reliable proxy for measuring economic development, urbanization, population density, and electricity availability.

## Content Breakdown

### 1. Introduction
The notebook starts by explaining the rationale behind using nighttime satellite data:
- Nighttime luminosity correlates strongly with human activities and infrastructure.
- Satellite-derived data helps measure economic factors even in areas with limited traditional economic data.

### 2. Data Sources and Preparation
- **Data Acquisition**: It describes the source of satellite images, typically from satellites like DMSP-OLS or VIIRS.
- **Data Formats**: Explanation about raster data formats such as GeoTIFF.
- **Data Preparation**: Steps include data downloading, cleaning, preprocessing, and visualizing initial data.

### 3. Processing Satellite Imagery Data
The notebook contains Julia code snippets for:
- Loading raster images and reading geospatial data.
- Inspecting the metadata (geographic projection, resolution, bounds, etc.).
- Data transformation (rescaling pixel values to represent light intensity accurately).

Example Julia code for loading raster data:
```julia
using ArchGDAL, GDAL

# Load raster data
dataset = ArchGDAL.read("nighttime_lights.tif")

# Inspect metadata
print(dataset)
```

### 4. Analyzing Nighttime Lights Data
Analysis procedures are included, such as:
- Extracting pixel values for specific geographic regions.
- Aggregating luminosity values at administrative boundaries (countries, states, districts).
- Correlating luminosity data with socioeconomic indicators.

Example of analysis in Julia:
```julia
using DataFrames

# Aggregate luminosity by administrative region
region_lights = DataFrame(region=["Region A", "Region B"], luminosity=[234.5, 187.3])

# Analyze correlation
correlation(region_lights.luminosity, region_lights.economic_indicator)
```

### 5. Visualization
This section focuses on creating maps and graphs to visualize economic activity:
- Spatial plotting of nighttime data using mapping libraries like Makie.jl or GeoMakie.jl.
- Creating scatter plots and histograms for data distribution and statistical analysis.

Sample visualization:
```julia
using GeoMakie

# Plot spatial distribution of lights
GeoMakie.plot(dataset)
```

### 6. Economic Analysis & Interpretation
It provides insights into interpreting nighttime data in an economic context:
- Discussion of limitations, like saturation effects and cloud cover.
- How to improve analysis through calibration with ground-level economic data.

### 7. Applications and Use-Cases
The notebook outlines practical use-cases:
- Monitoring economic development in developing countries.
- Assessing disaster impact or conflict zones.
- Tracking urban sprawl and infrastructure development.

### 8. Conclusion
Summarizes findings and encourages further exploration:
- Recommendations for additional data sources (e.g., socioeconomic datasets, ground truth data).
- Suggestions for advanced analytical techniques.

### Code Snippets Example
The notebook contains several clearly explained Julia code snippets, showing best practices in geospatial data handling, manipulation, and analysis.

For instance:
```julia
# Example of calculating mean luminosity per administrative area
mean_luminosity = mean(region_pixels_values)
```

### Dependencies and Environment Setup
- A detailed description of required Julia packages (`ArchGDAL.jl`, `DataFrames.jl`, `Makie.jl`, etc.).
- Instructions for installation and setting up a Julia environment.

```julia
# Install necessary packages
using Pkg
Pkg.add(["ArchGDAL", "DataFrames", "Makie"])
```

## Final Notes
This notebook is a comprehensive guide on integrating remote sensing data into economic analyses using Julia. It combines theoretical context, practical coding examples, and robust interpretation guidelines. This resource is especially beneficial for those interested in economics, geography, urban planning, and remote sensing.

For further detailed steps, executing the notebook interactively in a Julia environment is highly recommended.
