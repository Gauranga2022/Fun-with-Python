# Day 4: Fine-Tuning a Custom Model

This notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to fine-tune a custom model on a specific task. Throughout the notebook, you will learn how to prepare data, set up your environment, modify a pre-trained model, and perform training and evaluation. The techniques covered here are fundamental for adapting pre-trained models to your domain-specific tasks.

## Overview

In this notebook, we walk through the process of fine-tuning a pre-trained model for a custom task. Fine-tuning is a key technique in modern machine learning, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision, which allows you to adapt a model to your task with relatively small amounts of task-specific data.

Key steps include:

- **Data Preparation:** Importing and processing your dataset to make it suitable for training.
- **Model Customization:** Loading a pre-trained model and modifying its architecture (if necessary) for the new task.
- **Training:** Configuring the training loop, defining loss functions, and optimizing the model parameters.
- **Evaluation:** Measuring model performance using relevant metrics and validation data.
- **Deployment:** Saving the fine-tuned model for future inference or integration.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this notebook, you will be able to:

- Understand the process of fine-tuning a pre-trained model.
- Prepare and preprocess datasets for training.
- Modify and customize a model to better suit a specific task.
- Implement a training loop and evaluate model performance.
- Save and export a fine-tuned model for deployment.

## Environment Setup and Dependencies

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- **Python 3.x** – The notebook assumes a Python environment.
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** For example, if you're using PyTorch:
  ```bash
  pip install torch torchvision
  ```
- **Transformers Library:** (if using Hugging Face models)
  ```bash
  pip install transformers
  ```
- **Additional Libraries:** Such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
  ```
- **GPU (optional):** For faster training, a GPU-enabled device is recommended.

## Notebook Structure

### 1. Initialization and Importing Libraries

The notebook begins by importing necessary libraries and setting up any required configurations, such as seed initialization for reproducibility and device allocation (CPU vs. GPU). An example cell might look like:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import torch
from torch import nn, optim
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Set random seeds for reproducibility
np.random.seed(42)
torch.manual_seed(42)

# Choose device: GPU if available, else CPU
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
```

### 2. Data Loading and Preprocessing

In this section, you will load your dataset (from CSV, JSON, or other sources) and perform necessary preprocessing steps. This could include:

- **Cleaning:** Removing missing values, formatting text, etc.
- **Tokenization:** Splitting text into tokens if working on NLP tasks.
- **Splitting Data:** Dividing the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

Example snippet:
```python
# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv("data/dataset.csv")

# Preprocess and tokenize the text
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
data["tokens"] = data["text"].apply(lambda x: tokenizer.encode(x, add_special_tokens=True))

# Split the data
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
train_data, test_data = train_test_split(data, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### 3. Setting Up the Custom Model

Here, you load a pre-trained model using a library (like Hugging Face Transformers) and adjust it if needed for your specific task (for example, changing the output layer for a different number of classes):

```python
# Load a pre-trained model for sequence classification
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased", num_labels=2)
model.to(device)
```

You may also include code to modify the model architecture further or freeze certain layers if needed.

### 4. Fine-Tuning Process

This section details the training loop and fine-tuning process, including:

- **Defining the Optimizer and Loss Function:**
  ```python
  optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=2e-5)
  criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
  ```
- **Training Loop:** Iterating over the training data, computing loss, and updating model weights.
  ```python
  num_epochs = 3
  for epoch in range(num_epochs):
      model.train()
      for batch in train_dataloader:
          inputs = batch['input_ids'].to(device)
          labels = batch['labels'].to(device)
          
          optimizer.zero_grad()
          outputs = model(inputs).logits
          loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
          loss.backward()
          optimizer.step()
      print(f"Epoch {epoch+1} completed.")
  ```
- **Validation:** Optionally, include code to evaluate performance on the validation set after each epoch.

### 5. Evaluating the Model

After training, the notebook discusses techniques to measure model performance:

- **Evaluation Metrics:** Compute accuracy, precision, recall, or other metrics based on your task.
- **Visualization:** Plot training curves (e.g., loss vs. epochs) to assess convergence.
  
Example:
```python
# Evaluate on test data
model.eval()
total, correct = 0, 0
with torch.no_grad():
    for batch in test_dataloader:
        inputs = batch['input_ids'].to(device)
        labels = batch['labels'].to(device)
        outputs = model(inputs).logits
        _, predicted = torch.max(outputs, dim=1)
        total += labels.size(0)
        correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()

accuracy = correct / total
print(f"Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```

### 6. Saving and Exporting the Model

The final section shows how to save the fine-tuned model and tokenizer for future use:
```python
model.save_pretrained("fine_tuned_model")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("fine_tuned_model")
```
This enables you to load the model later for inference or further fine-tuning.

## Conclusion and Future Work

In summary, this notebook guides you through the process of fine-tuning a custom model:
- **Data Preparation:** Ensuring your data is clean and in the correct format.
- **Model Customization:** Adjusting a pre-trained model for your task.
- **Training and Evaluation:** Setting up a training loop and evaluating the model’s performance.
- **Deployment:** Saving your model for later use.

### Possible Extensions:
- Experiment with different hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, or number of epochs.
- Try alternative pre-trained models to see if a different architecture performs better.
- Incorporate more advanced techniques like learning rate schedulers or gradient clipping.
- Integrate additional evaluation metrics for a thorough model assessment.
